    <p>
        Nigeria is often called the "Giant of Africa." This name comes from the vastness of its land, the diversity of its peoples and languages,
         its huge population (the largest in Africa), and its oil and other natural resources. 
         Nigeria is a patchwork of distinctive regions, including deserts, plains, swamps, and jungles
